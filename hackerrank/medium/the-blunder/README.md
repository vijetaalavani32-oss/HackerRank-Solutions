## Problem

Samantha was tasked with calculating the average monthly salaries for all employees in the **EMPLOYEES** table, but did not realize her keyboard's $0$ key was broken until after completing the calculation. She wants your help finding the difference between her miscalculation (using salaries with any zeros removed), and the actual average salary.

Write a query calculating the amount of error (i.e.: $actual - miscalculated$ average monthly salaries), and round it up to the next integer.

**Input Format**

The **EMPLOYEES** table is described as follows:

**Constraints**

 $1000 \lt \text{Salary} \lt 10^5$. 

**Output Format**
