## Problem

Amber's conglomerate corporation just acquired some new companies. Each of the companies follows this hierarchy: <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/19505/1458531031-249df3ae87-ScreenShot2016-03-21at8.59.56AM.png"/>

Given the table schemas below, write a query to print the _company\_code_, _founder_ name, total number of _lead_ managers, total number of _senior_ managers, total number of _managers_, and total number of _employees_. Order your output by ascending _company\_code_.

**Note:**

- The tables may contain duplicate records.
- The _company\_code_ is string, so the sorting should not be **numeric**. For example, if the _company\_codes_ are _C\_1_, _C\_2_, and _C\_10_, then the ascending _company\_codes_ will be _C\_1_, _C\_10_, and _C\_2_.
