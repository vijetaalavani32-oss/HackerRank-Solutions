# Type of Triangle

## Problem

Generate the following two result sets:

1. Query an *alphabetically ordered* list of all names in **OCCUPATIONS**, immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses). For example: `AnActorName(A)`, `ADoctorName(D)`, `AProfessorName(P)`, and `ASingerName(S)`.  
2. Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in **OCCUPATIONS**. Sort the occurrences in *ascending order*, and output them in the following format:	<br>
		
        There are a total of [occupation_count] [occupation]s.

    where `[occupation_count]` is the number of occurrences of an occupation in **OCCUPATIONS** and `[occupation]` is the *lowercase* occupation name. If more than one *Occupation* has the same `[occupation_count]`, they should be ordered alphabetically.
    
**Note:** There will be at least two entries in the table for each type of occupation.

**Input Format**

The **OCCUPATIONS** table is described as follows:

*Occupation* will only contain one of the following values: **Doctor**, **Professor**, **Singer** or **Actor**.

```db2
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN A + B <= C OR A + C <= B OR B + C <= A
            THEN 'Not A Triangle'
        WHEN A = B AND B = C
            THEN 'Equilateral'
        WHEN A = B OR B = C OR A = C
            THEN 'Isosceles'
        ELSE 'Scalene'
    END
FROM TRIANGLES;

```
