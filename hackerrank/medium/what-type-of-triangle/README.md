# Type of Triangle

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Write a query identifying the *type* of each record in the **TRIANGLES** table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

- **Equilateral**: It's a triangle with $3$ sides of equal length.
- **Isosceles**: It's a triangle with $2$ sides of equal length.
- **Scalene**: It's a triangle with $3$ sides of differing lengths.
- **Not A Triangle**: The given values of *A*, *B*, and *C* don't form a triangle.

**Input Format**

The **TRIANGLES** table is described as follows:

Each row in the table denotes the lengths of each of a triangle's three sides.

```db2
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN A + B <= C OR A + C <= B OR B + C <= A
            THEN 'Not A Triangle'
        WHEN A = B AND B = C
            THEN 'Equilateral'
        WHEN A = B OR B = C OR A = C
            THEN 'Isosceles'
        ELSE 'Scalene'
    END
FROM TRIANGLES;

```
