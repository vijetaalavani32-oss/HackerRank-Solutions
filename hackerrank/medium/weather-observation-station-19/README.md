## Problem

Consider $P_1(a, c)$ and $P_2(b, d)$ to be two points on a 2D plane where $(a, b)$ are the respective minimum and maximum values of *Northern Latitude* (*LAT\_N*) and $(c, d)$ are the respective minimum and maximum values of *Western Longitude* (*LONG\_W*) in **STATION**. 

Query the [Euclidean Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) between points $P_1$ and $P_2$ and *format your answer* to display $4$ decimal digits.

**Input Format**

The **STATION** table is described as follows:

where *LAT\_N* is the northern latitude and *LONG\_W* is the western longitude. 

**Constraints**
