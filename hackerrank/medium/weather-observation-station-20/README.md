## Problem

A *[median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median)* is defined as a number separating the higher half of a data set from the lower half. Query the *median* of the *Northern Latitudes* (*LAT\_N*) from **STATION** and round your answer to $4$ decimal places. 


**Input Format**

The **STATION** table is described as follows:

FROM (
    SELECT LAT_N,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY LAT_N) AS row_num,
           COUNT(*) OVER () AS total_rows
    FROM STATION
) AS t
WHERE row_num IN (
    FLOOR((total_rows + 1) / 2),
    CEIL((total_rows + 1) / 2)
);
